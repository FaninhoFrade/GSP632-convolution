## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language for this project.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **SciPy:** For advanced image processing functions.
- **Google Cloud:** To leverage cloud computing resources.

## How to Use

To use the GSP632 Convolution project, follow these steps:

1. **Load an Image:**

   Use the provided functions to load an image from your local machine or cloud storage.

   ```python
   from image_loader import load_image
   image = load_image('path/to/image.jpg')
   ```

2. **Apply Convolution:**

   Create a 3x3 filter and apply it to the loaded image.

   ```python
   from convolution import apply_convolution
   filter = [[1, 0, -1], [1, 0, -1], [1, 0, -1]]
   convolved_image = apply_convolution(image, filter)
   ```

3. **Visualize the Results:**

   Use the visualization tools to display the original and processed images.

   ```python
   from visualization import show_images
   show_images(original=image, processed=convolved_image)
   ```

4. **Pooling:**

   Implement pooling techniques to reduce the image size while retaining important features.

   ```python
   from pooling import apply_pooling
   pooled_image = apply_pooling(convolved_image)
   ```

5. **Save Your Work:**

   Save the processed images to your local storage or cloud.

   ```python
   from image_saver import save_image
   save_image(pooled_image, 'path/to/save/image.jpg')
   ```

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use the GSP632 Convolution project effectively.

### Example 1: Edge Detection

In this example, we will use a simple edge detection filter.

```python
from image_loader import load_image
from convolution import apply_convolution
from visualization import show_images

image = load_image('path/to/image.jpg')
filter = [[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 8, -1], [-1, -1, -1]]
edges = apply_convolution(image, filter)
show_images(original=image, processed=edges)
```

### Example 2: Image Downsampling

This example demonstrates how to downsample an image using max pooling.

```python
from image_loader import load_image
from pooling import apply_pooling
from visualization import show_images

image = load_image('path/to/image.jpg')
pooled_image = apply_pooling(image)
show_images(original=image, processed=pooled_image)
```
